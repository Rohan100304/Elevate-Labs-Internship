## 🎯 Task Objective

To learn and implement how Python can be used to:
- Connect to an SQL database
- Execute SQL queries
- Fetch and process data
- Visualizing the query

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Jupyter**
- **MySQL** 
- `mysql-connector-python` 
- `pandas` for data manipulation

---

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

- Establishing DB connection via Python
- Executing `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries
- Reading SQL data into pandas DataFrames
- Writing DataFrames back to SQL tables
- Using parameterized queries for secure operations
