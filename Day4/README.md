# Day 3: SQL with Northwind Database


### Overview
On Day 3, I worked with the **Northwind** database to deepen my understanding of SQL operations, focusing on data retrieval, joins, subqueries, views, and query optimization.

### Key Tasks:
- **Queries:** Used `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` for data extraction and summarization.
- **Joins:** Implemented `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` for combining tables.
- **Subqueries:** Wrote subqueries to find products above average price and customers with more than 10 orders.
- **Views:** Created views like `CustomersWithOrderCount` and `SalesPerProduct` to simplify complex queries.

### Tools Used:
- **MySQL** and **Northwind database**

### Learnings:
- Understanding the impact of joins and indexing on query performance.
- Simplifying complex queries with views and subqueries.
